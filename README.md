## WEAVIATE 

<p>
  Weaviate is an open-source vector search engine designed for managing and querying large-scale, high-dimensional vector data. It performs similarity searches by converting data into vectors and using these vectors to find similar items, making it ideal for applications like semantic search, recommendation systems, and image retrieval. Weaviate supports flexible schema management, allowing users to define data structures and relationships, and integrates with machine learning models

## WORKING 
<p>This project sets up a Weaviate vector search engine with Hugging Face embeddings to create a searchable text database. It involves installing necessary libraries, importing them, and defining functions for text splitting, embedding initialization, and schema creation. Text from a file is split into chunks, vectorized, and ingested into Weaviate. The script then performs a similarity search for the term "Thermocouple" and prints the results in JSON format.</p>
